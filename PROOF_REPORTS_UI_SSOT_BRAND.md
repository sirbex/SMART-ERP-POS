# PROOF — Reports UI SSOT + brand-free

**Verdict:** PASS
**Proven at:** 2026-08-23T12:13:51.867Z
**Gates:** 24/24 passed

## What this proves
- Competitor-brand token absence in report UI source
- isSsotReportType gates generic summary + table
- Dedicated renderers ⊆ SSOT sets (with documented supplemental exclusions)
- Customer Aging single-fetch short-circuit
- Supplier combobox + statement renderer wiring
- Server envelope/PDF structural alignment

## Explicitly NOT proven
- Live numeric accuracy of GL balances / P&L totals (requires API+DB fixture proof)
- Non-report modules elsewhere in the app
